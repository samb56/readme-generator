  ## Description 
  In order to simplify the process of creating uniformly formatted readme files, this project was put together to make an input driven line of prompts to create a readme file. Through answering simple questions about the project one is working on, the script will put together a markup file and display the information in their correct sections with proper table of contents and titles. The program makes creating nicely formatted readme files as easy and filling in the info as if you're typing out what the project consists of, and the rest of the work is done for you. Through this project Ive learned about properly using the inquirer tool and utilizing the data it obtains from user input.

  ## Installation 
  Installing the readme generator consists of downloading the zip folder from the repository. Next you need to access the directory within a terminal(ex. GitBash, integrated VSC terminal, ect.) and install requirer. Next the command "node index.js" needs to be entered to initiate the prompt. If a prompt appears asking about the title of the project, then the program was installed correctly.

  ## Usage 
  Once installed, a terminal is needed to access the location of the directory that contains the index.js. Once in the proper directory, execute the "node index.js" command and you will get a confirmation in the form of the first prompt question being asked. Each prompt question needs either text input which is typed in followed by using the enter key to move onto the next one or consists of a list imput which has a highlighted default selection. For the list input, use the arrow keys on the keypad to highlight the choice that fits the project and press enter to select. Once all of the prompts have been finished, there should be a success confirmation within the console, followed by the creation of a readme.md file within the directory being accessed to use the program. After that the program can be run again using the same command.
